The expected behaviour of the expectations JLEX-01 and JLEX-02 is sufficiently broken-down.

Note: Here I want to reference all the statements below JLEX-01 and -02, but this would be a very long list. Would it be an option to reference the whole trustable graph or is this implicitely already assumed?
